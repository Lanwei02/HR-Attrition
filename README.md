The dataset used in this project is from [here](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/)
* Implemented decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting to build a model that could identify 71.42%(recall) of employee attrition by tackling data imbalance using up-sampling, down-sampling and SMOTE, and adjusting the threshold.
* Analyzed critical features to figure out the reasons for employee attrition.
